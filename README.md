# Recognize protein domains with hidden Markov Models

Repository for the Algorithms for Sequence Analysis assignment (VU University Amsterdam, December 2016)

The scripts train a Hidden Markov Model algorithm, to recognise domain and linker regions in protein sequences. Specifically the Viterbi and the Baum Welch algorithms.

The script main_program.py calls the different functions.

In the main() function of the main_program.py, it is possible to choose to create random sequences at the beginning of every run.
